	<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>My assessment has undergone many changes, the most sustainable been a complete redesign or redo of the of the website itself. I decided to redo the website design as I believe it was not effective at both presenting the information required and demonstrating my knowledge of both html and css. While the design was functional, it was over complex resulting in a loss of clarity and a less responsive experience when navigating the site. When designing the new site I wanted to create a site that is both responsive and light-weight on the browser while incorporating a clean and seamless aesthetic. I believe the current site has fulfilled these goals while also demonstrating my improved knowledge of html and css.</p>
		<p>In terms of educational value I have both refined and developed skills in website development. I believe this is most evident when comparing my previous website design with the final site I have produced. </p>
		<p>Overall, the task was enjoyable and I confident in the work produced.</p>
