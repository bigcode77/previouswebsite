			<h3>Evaluation</h3>
				<p>As shown in my design plan and final design my website has undergone many changes. Two major changes were the remove of an image carousel and animated tiles on the website. This was done to improve the flow of the website and due to the complexity of integrating these features. The website theme also has undergone changes with the switch to a colourful light theme and the introduction of parallax backgrounds. This was done to improve the websites aesthetic and usability. The navbar was also improved with the image-link and other links no longer segregated and highlighted on hover and when viewing the corresponding page. This was again done to improve the websites aesthetic and usability. </p>
		
				<p>In terms of educational value I have both refined and developed skills in website development. I believe this is most evident in this landing pages design and when comparing previous (website tasks) with this one. </p>
				
				<p>Overall, the task was enjoyable and I confident in the work produced.</p>
